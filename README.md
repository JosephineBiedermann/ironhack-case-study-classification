## Project brief
**Scenario:**
We are risk analysts employed at a bank. Our team is focusing on credit card services.
We are given data from 18.000 of our customers and our boss wants us to work out how we can improve our credit card marketing campaign.

**Challenge:**
Use the given data set to find out what characteristics impact the customers decision on accepting or declining our credit card offer.

**Problem:**
Can we predict if our customer accepts or declines the credit card offer?

## Key Take Aways

### 1. Our model can predict a customer accepting or declining the credit card offer with an accuracy of 84%
### 2. We suspect the following features to impact the customers decision to accept the most:
  - mailer type
  - avg balance
  - income level
  - reward
